## Check-ins

- At the start of each work session we will have a brief check in. 
- anytime that we are stuck we will have a check in
- when we PR we may also do a check in

## Project Organization

- [github project](https://github.com/users/austincarrjones/projects/2)
- [Miro Board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVKTnYqIg=/)
- We discussed what we did in our pair project, talked about our experiences. we then looked at the project requirements and used a miro board to start thinking about the direction we would take.

## Code Design

- we looked at the csv files to understand the data better. 
- we thought about the classes that we would need and how they would interact.
- visually mapped our plan out in a miro board.

### What has gone well
- Staying on the same call even while working async, so if anyone gets stuck on something, the other people are there to chime in.
- Assigning tasks on our google sheets document helped me know what I can be working on.
- GIT workflow has been strong and we have been keeping up with pull requests really well.

### What we would do differently in the future
- Create mini deadlines for when we want to get things done.
- We could do a better job at testing, in this case testing against the spec harness before pushing to main.
- We could have done a better job at dividing up the work load. The way we originally divided tasks up, some people had more work than others.
